InnSIM, carefully designed, highly-contrasted illumination patterns are combined with thesaturation of an optical transition to enable sub-diffraction imaging. While the techniqueproved useful for two-dimensional imaging, extending it to three-dimensions is challengingdue to the fading of organicfluorophores under intense cycling conditions. Here, we present acompressed sensing approach that allows 3D sub-diffraction nSIM of cultured cells bysaturatingfluorescence excitation. Exploiting the natural orthogonality of speckles at differentaxial  planes,  3D  probing  of  the  sample  is  achieved  by  a  single  two-dimensional  scan.Fluorescence contrast under saturated excitation is ensured by the inherent high density ofintensity minima associated with optical vortices in polarized speckle patterns. Compressedspeckle microscopy is thus a simple approach that enables 3D super-resolved nSIM imagingwith potentially considerably reduced acquisition time and photobleaching.","tags":[],"title":"Compressive three-dimensional super-resolution microscopy with speckle-saturated fluorescence excitation","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1548090180,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548090180,"objectID":"442cc69c07c64548af31fa524442c28b","permalink":"https://mpascucci.github.io/projects/astapp/","publishdate":"2019-01-21T18:03:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/projects/astapp/","section":"projects","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"ASTapp","type":"projects"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"","date":1513776636,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1513776636,"objectID":"3ea736fca6813c96532c9bee39f1bdb3","permalink":"https://mpascucci.github.io/talk/stateofther/","publishdate":"2017-12-20T14:30:36+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/stateofther/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"State of the R seminary 2017","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"","date":1498206636,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1498206636,"objectID":"9c5a8e3f5a01d4e6ba3267f52c50f4fa","permalink":"https://mpascucci.github.io/talk/cleoeurope/","publishdate":"2017-06-23T09:30:36+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/cleoeurope/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"CLEO Europe 2017","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"","date":1491726636,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1491726636,"objectID":"1610fc127f15e5b1c16974bf060e0e55","permalink":"https://mpascucci.github.io/talk/fom2017/","publishdate":"2017-04-09T09:30:36+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/fom2017/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Focus On Mycroscopy 2017","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"","date":1489164036,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1489164036,"objectID":"2496b0a7b9819ce4a4f90bb140f06c36","permalink":"https://mpascucci.github.io/talk/frisno20157/","publishdate":"2017-03-10T17:40:36+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/frisno20157/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Frisno 2017","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"","date":1457110088,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1457110088,"objectID":"22d9edc9bfdda8916f4a2fcee2cbb2ce","permalink":"https://mpascucci.github.io/publication/prl/","publishdate":"2016-03-04T17:48:08+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/prl/","section":"publication","summary":"We characterize, experimentally, the intensity minima of a polarized high numerical aperture optical speckle pattern and the topological charges of the associated optical vortices. The negative of a speckle pattern is imprinted in a uniform fluorescent sample by photobleaching. The remaining fluorescence is imaged with superresolution stimulated emission depletion microscopy, which reveals subdiffraction fluorescence confinement at the center of optical vortices. The intensity statistics of saturated negative speckle patterns are predicted and measured. The charge of optical vortices is determined by controlling the handedness of circular polarization, and the creation or annihilation of a vortex pair along propagation is shown.","tags":[],"title":"Superresolution imaging of optical vortices in a speckle pattern","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"","date":1389545288,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1389545288,"objectID":"7b35cf35347227821a36a9b1046944e8","permalink":"https://mpascucci.github.io/publication/morante/","publishdate":"2014-01-12T17:48:08+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/morante/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper we report a systematic XAS study of a set of samples in which Cu(II) was progressively added to complexes in which Zn(II) was bound to the tetra-octarepeat portion of the prion protein. This work extends previous EPR and XAS analysis in which, in contrast, the effect of adding Zn(II) to Cu(II)–tetra-octarepeat complexes was investigated. Detailed structural analysis of the XAS spectra taken at both the Cu and Zn K-edge when the two metals are present at different relative concentrations revealed that Zn(II) and Cu(II) ions compete for binding to the tetra-octarepeat peptide by cross-regulating their relative binding modes. We show that the specific metal–peptide coordination mode depends not only, as expected, on the relative metal concentrations, but also on whether Zn(II) or Cu(II) was first bound to the peptide. In particular, it seems that the Zn(II) binding mode in the absence of Cu(II) is able to …","tags":[],"title":"Copper–zinc cross-modulation in prion protein binding","type":"publication"}]
