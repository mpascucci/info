InnSIM, carefully designed, highly-contrasted illumination patterns are combined with thesaturation of an optical transition to enable sub-diffraction imaging. While the techniqueproved useful for two-dimensional imaging, extending it to three-dimensions is challengingdue to the fading of organicfluorophores under intense cycling conditions. Here, we present acompressed sensing approach that allows 3D sub-diffraction nSIM of cultured cells bysaturatingfluorescence excitation. Exploiting the natural orthogonality of speckles at differentaxial  planes,  3D  probing  of  the  sample  is  achieved  by  a  single  two-dimensional  scan.Fluorescence contrast under saturated excitation is ensured by the inherent high density ofintensity minima associated with optical vortices in polarized speckle patterns. Compressedspeckle microscopy is thus a simple approach that enables 3D super-resolved nSIM imagingwith potentially considerably reduced acquisition time and photobleaching.","tags":[],"title":"Compressive three-dimensional super-resolution microscopy with speckle-saturated fluorescence excitation","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1548090180,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548090180,"objectID":"442cc69c07c64548af31fa524442c28b","permalink":"https://mpascucci.github.io/projects/astapp/","publishdate":"2019-01-21T18:03:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/projects/astapp/","section":"projects","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"ASTapp","type":"projects"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" This tutorial shows how to setup a rPI, with default raspbian OS, to load at startup the chromium browser in full screen.

The browser will be the only running graphical application. There is a wrong (complicated) way to do it, and a much easyer.\n The right way is to create a custom LXDE autostart script in the home folder:\n$ nano /home/pi/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart  The content of this file should be something like this:\n################################################# # LXDE-pi autostart script # # # # This file must be in the user's home e.g. # # /home/pi/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart. # ################################################# ## enable/disable screen saver #@xscreensaver -no-splash # comment this line out to disable screensaver # Set the current xsession not to blank out the screensaver and then disables the screensaver altogether. @xset s noblank @xset s off # disables the display power management system @xset -dpms # Run the wanted app @bash /home/pi/kiosk.sh   as you see, at the end, it calls a kiosk.sh located in /home/pi.

We will go through each of these parameters so you know what you can modify, and how you can modify it. ### --kiosk : operate in kiosk mode (limited acces to browser and OS e.g. no system bar, no tabs) ### --noerrdialogs : do not show error dialogs ### --disable-infobars : disable info bar (e.g. \u0026quot;chroium is not de default browser\u0026quot;) ### --start-fullscreen (not necessary in kiosk mode) ### --incognito chromium-browser --noerrdialogs --disable-infobars --incognito --kiosk http://localhost:8080/ # You may want to enclose the btowser command in a *while loop* to reopen the browser when user closes it instead of closing x server. # In this case add an `\u0026amp;` at the end of the browser line: # #while true; do #chromium-browser --noerrdialogs --disable-infobars --incognito --kiosk http://localhost:8080/\u0026amp; #done  IMPORTANT: Be sure to set the address of the site you want to show in chromium. Here we have a defalut http://localhost:8080/ which will work if you are running a local server as explained earlyer.

This work extends previous EPR and XAS analysis in which, in contrast, the effect of adding Zn(II) to Cu(II)–tetra-octarepeat complexes was investigated. Detailed structural analysis of the XAS spectra taken at both the Cu and Zn K-edge when the two metals are present at different relative concentrations revealed that Zn(II) and Cu(II) ions compete for binding to the tetra-octarepeat peptide by cross-regulating their relative binding modes. We show that the specific metal–peptide coordination mode depends not only, as expected, on the relative metal concentrations, but also on whether Zn(II) or Cu(II) was first bound to the peptide. In particular, it seems that the Zn(II) binding mode in the absence of Cu(II) is able to …","tags":[],"title":"Copper–zinc cross-modulation in prion protein binding","type":"publication"}]
