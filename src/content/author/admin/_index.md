I am a physicist interested in computer science and postdoc researcher at the Mathematics and modeling laboratory of Évry (LaMME).
I have the background and education of a physicist and did a PhD in optical microscopy (super-resolution with random illumination patterns). I am interested in computer science and did a MS in computer science at CNAM (Conservatoire National des Arts et Metiers, Paris) during my PhD.

In 2018 I joined Médecins Sans Frontieres in the effort of fighting antimicrobial resistances, by starting from scratch the first smartphone-based automatic system for reading disk-diffusion antibiograms. The prototype developed in one year won the [Google AI Impact Challenge 2019](https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/google-org/ai-impact-challenge-grantees/).

My PhD project was at the same time an experimental and theoretical challenge. It involved the whole design of a new microscope (hardware and driving software), modelling complex light structures and the design of advanced image processing algorithms. If I had to summarize the adventure in a sentence I would say that “during my PhD I developed a novel microscopy technique based on randomly interfering light (apparent disorder) which allows, under certain sparsity constraints, the reconstruction a 3D object from a bi-dimensional image”. I found this idea of retrieving information from partial and chaotic data very exciting.

I like working in interdisciplinary environments where I can bring and make value of my diverse experiences and interests in a team with a wide spectrum of activities and different axes of research. 
During my experiences in both fields of physics and computer science, I enjoined the rigorous frameworks of mathematical modelling and abstract reasoning.

Undoubtedly, most of my experiences are in image processing and scientific computing. Nevertheless I have interests in statistics and in the practical and formal aspects of software development (e.g. algorithms optimization, computational linguistics and programming language theory and proof)
