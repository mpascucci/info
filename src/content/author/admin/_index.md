This application is a project of MSF Foundation (Médecins Sans Frontières) and uses digital image processing and AI to interpret simple pictures taken with a telephone camera.

He has the background and education of a physicist and did a PhD in optical microscopy (super-resolution with random illumination patterns). he obtained a MS in Computer Science from CNAM (Conservatoire National des Arts et Metiers, Paris).

Additionally, Marco is an enthusiast and passionate about software design.
